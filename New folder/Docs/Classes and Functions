Node:

Represents a node in the computation graph. Each node contains an operation and its inputs.
ComputationGraph:

Represents the computation graph. It allows adding nodes, removing nodes, and visualizing the graph.
AddOperation and MulOperation:

Modules representing addition and multiplication operations, respectively.
Optimizer:

A class implementing optimization techniques for the computation graph. It currently supports fusion of consecutive multiplication and addition operations.
ExecutionEngine:

Executes the computation graph given input tensors.
